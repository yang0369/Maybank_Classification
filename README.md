## About

This is a data science project, where I have created an end-to-end training and inference pipeline by XGBoost model.


## Quick Tour

1. To run the EDA and Model building, can simply run the jupyter notebooks in analysis/ folder.
2. To run the end-to-end training pipeline, can look into src/E2EPipeline.py.
3. All the required dependencies are included in requirement.txt, it is recommended to build a conda environment.
4. I have also prepared a deck of slides to share the deatils.
